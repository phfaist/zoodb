   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ZooDb's documentation!
=================================

ZooDb is a simple library I wrote to build technical “zoos”: A collection of
ideas or concepts, mapped out and organized to bring out their structure and
relations.

This library forms the core of the `Error Correction Zoo
<https://errorcorrectionzoo.org/>`_.  I might use it to build other zoos in the
future.  Feel free to use it to build your own zoo, too!
